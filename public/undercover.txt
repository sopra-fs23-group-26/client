Game rules:

1. The game starts with each player receiving a word, but one player is the "undercover" and has a different word than the other players, who are the "detectives."

2. At the start of each round, every player describes their word using one sentence without saying the actual word.

3. After all players have described their word in a round, players must vote for who they think is the undercover, and the player who receives the most votes in this round is voted out.

4. If the undercover is correctly voted out, the detectives win the game and each get 2 points.

5. If the undercover is not voted out, the game continues until only two players are left and one of them is the undercover.

6. If the remaining players include the undercover and one detective, the undercover wins the game and gets 5 points.
